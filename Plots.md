# Issues
This section contain the issues that would need further work upon while doing Project.
This May lead to more hours in Project:
1. Better Geo-location extraction
2. Better Maps api - currently used: openstreet, Should try: GoogleMapsAPI
    Reason - based on name provided of location openstreet lack semantic searches.
